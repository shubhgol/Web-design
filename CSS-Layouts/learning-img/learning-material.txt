position css property

1) static --->

    every element has a static position by default, so the element will stick to the normal page flow. 
    So if there is a left/right/top/bottom/z-index set then there will be no effect on that element.

2) relative--->
   
   an element’s original position remains in the flow of the document, just like the static value. 
   But now left/right/top/bottom/z-index will work. The positional properties “nudge” the element from the original position in that direction.

3) fixed*--->
    
    An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. 
    The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element.

    A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located.

    Notice the fixed element in the lower-right corner of the page. Here is the CSS that is used:
    
     div.fixed {
       position: fixed;
       bottom: 0;
       right: 0;
       width: 300px;
       border: 3px solid #73AD21;
       }


4) absolute--->
    
    The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout. 
    It is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor.
    if any; otherwise, it is placed relative to the initial containing block. 
    Its final position is determined by the values of top, right, bottom, and left.
    
5) sticky

>>>>>>>>> selector
1) Simple selector(select elements based on name, id, class)
2) combinators selector
3) pseudo class selector(:)
4) pseudo element selector(::)(::first-line,::first-letter,::before,::after)
5) attribute selector()

1) div, #id, .class
2) There are four different combinators selector in CSS

      descendant selector (space)(div p)
      child selector (>)(div>p)
      adjacent sibling selector (+)(div+p)
      general sibling selector (~)(div~p)

3) select elements based on a certain state
     a:link, a:visited, a:hover, a:active
     /* when we mix multiple elements inside of parent element then the pseudo classes dont work really well */
     article p:first-child {color: red;}
    /* article p:last-child{color: red;} */

4) A CSS pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element.
    Style the first letter, or line, of an element
    Insert content before, or after, the content of an element
    p::first-line {color: #ff0000;font-variant: small-caps;}

5) [attribute] selector is used to select elements with a specified attribute.
     a[target] ---> having attribute target
     a[target="_blank"]--> having attribute target and value is _blank
     [title~="flower"]--> haing attribute title and value containing specified words flower
     [class|="top"]
     [attribute^="value"] selector is used to select elements with the specified attribute, whose value starts with the specified value.

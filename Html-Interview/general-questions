1) What are Semantic Elements?

   A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

   Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

   Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.

   example: 
           <article>
           <aside>
           <details>
           <figcaption>
           <figure>
           <footer>
           <header>
           <main>
           <mark>
           <nav>
           <section>
           <summary>header
           <time>

1) What are Semantic Elements?

   A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

   Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

   Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.

   example: 
           <article>
           <aside>
           <details>
           <figcaption>
           <figure>
           <footer>
           <header>
           <main>
           <mark>
           <nav>
           <section>
           <summary>header
           <time>
           
  2) display:none vs visiblity:hidden
      
      display:none means that the tag in question will not appear on the page at all (although you can still interact with it through the dom). 
      visibility:hidden means that unlike display:none , the tag is not visible, but space is allocated for it on the page. 
      The tag is rendered, it just isn't seen on the page
